# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a fully presentational business website for "AuraFlora" with a high-class, abstract pastel aesthetic across all sections.

**Planned changes:**
- Sticky frosted-glass navbar with AuraFlora wordmark and smooth-scroll links to all sections
- Full-viewport hero section with abstract pastel gradient background, brand name, refined tagline, and CTA button
- About section with asymmetric layout, offset columns, and abstract decorative blob/shape accents
- Services/Offerings section with 3–4 luxury service cards, each with a distinct pastel tint and smooth hover effects
- Gallery/showcase section with a 4–6 item grid using abstract pastel imagery
- Contact "Get in Touch" section with an elegant form (name, email, message) and styled submit button
- Footer with brand name, descriptor, social placeholder links, and copyright notice
- Global design system: curated pastel palette (blush rose, sage green, champagne gold, lavender mist), serif display headings, sans-serif body, generous whitespace, and abstract decorative elements (blobs, gradients, translucent overlays) throughout

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can browse a polished, single-page AuraFlora business website with a cohesive premium pastel identity, navigate between all sections via the sticky navbar, and submit a contact form (frontend only, no backend submission).
