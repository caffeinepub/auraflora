  "summary": "All four requirements (REQ-9, REQ-10, REQ-11, REQ-12) appear to be implemented in the diff. ContactSection shows the Gmail address as a mailto link, 'Mumbai' as studio, a 24–48 hour response notice, and an Instagram link. Footer removes Facebook/Pinterest, keeps only Instagram pointing to the correct URL, and shows updated contact details. The form submission uses a mailto: URI approach and sets submitted=true for the success message.",
