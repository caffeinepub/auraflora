  "summary": "The diff implements all 8 requirements comprehensively. All major sections (Hero, About, Services, Gallery, Contact, Navbar, Footer) are created with the required pastel design system, typography, decorative elements, and interactive features. All acceptance criteria appear to be met based on the evidence in the diff.",

      "reason": "The build request explicitly states 'User authentication or login' is a non-goal and 'No backend data persistence is needed'. The diff includes a full Internet Identity auth provider wrapping the app, an actor hook for backend calls, and React Query setup for authenticated actor management — none of which were requested.",
